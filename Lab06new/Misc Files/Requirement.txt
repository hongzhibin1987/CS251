Complete Exercise 24.4 with the following specifications / adjustments:
In Section 10.5, we introduced an employee-payroll hierarchy to calculate each employee's payroll.
In this exercise, we provide a database of employees that corresponds to the employee-payroll hierarchy.
A SQL script to create the *employees* database is provided with the examples for the chapter.

a) Add employees to the employee table.
b) Add payroll information to the appropriate table for each new employee.For example, for a salaried employee add the payroll information to the *salariedEmployees* table.
c) Complete the assignment using only a command prompt interface. No GUI (yet).
d) Write a while or do-while loop in main that repeatedly asks the user if they would like to enter another employee.
e) hen the user says "yes", a new method named addEmployee should be called.
f) This method prompts the user for the employee's first and last name, social security number, and birthday.
g) Validate the formatting of the SSN and the birthday and make the user re-enter this information if they mess up.
h) Randomly generate the employeeType data for the new employee as either: salariedEmployee or commissionEmployee
i) Randomly generate the departmentName data for the new employee from among: Sales, R&D, or HR
